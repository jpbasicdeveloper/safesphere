SafeSphere is a comprehensive safety and emergency management app designed to keep users informed, prepared, and protected in any emergency situation. It combines real-time information, location-based alerts, and practical tools into one easy-to-use platform, helping individuals and families respond effectively during emergencies.

# About the app
The app features four core functions:
1.Real-Time Emergency Alerts provide instant, verified updates on natural disasters, severe weather, and public safety incidents, filtered by the userâ€™s location to ensure accuracy and relevance.
2.Find Nearby Emergency Centers uses GPS and live data to locate hospitals, police stations, shelters, and other response facilities, offering directions and contact details for quick access to help.
3.Real-Time Crime Data maps local incidents, enabling users to identify high-risk areas and plan safer routes.
4.The Emergency Preparedness Checklist guides users through key safety steps, for assembling emergency kits, to enhance readiness before, during, and after an event.

# How it works
SafeSphere uses open datasets from local city and local state APIs. The data is cleaned and visualized with Python, Streamlit, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
